# Responsive header navigation and hamburger menu
This repository shows you how to create a responsive header navigation using HTML, CSS & a few lines of JavaScript.


## Mobile responsiveness
> This header template is fully responsive for all kinds of devices. Also, it **does not need any CSS or JavaScript framework or library.**

## How does it work for you?
After you download the repository, you will find all the necessary files and folders. However, the **CSS file lives in the "sass" folder.** But you **don't have to use SASS.** The only file you need in this folder is _"style.css"_ and ignore all other partials (_file.scss).
I included these files (partials) because some of you may like to use SASS. But if you don't like SASS, just ignore the other files in the "sass" folder and only look/work on "style.css."

## Where to get support or if you have any questions?
Most of you may not need extra support or don't have questions because of the simplicity. But if it's you who need help or has a question, then find my contact detail here:
